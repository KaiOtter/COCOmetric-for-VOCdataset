# COCOmetric-for-VOCdataset
Using coco object detection metric for evaluating dataset with VOC format 

Requirement:
1. pycocotools
2. Cython
and target framworks.

Notice, it has only been tested in mxnet/gluon project. However, it seems very esay and refers less on target inference framworks.

TODO:
support Pytorch and offer a pure numpy metric.

The guide is in the subdirectory, which is ahout how to use and how to modify your code for feeding prediction results in a correct format.
